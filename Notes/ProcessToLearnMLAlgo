Step by Step Process to Learn any ML Algo
==========================================
1. Understand the math behind algorithms
2. How these algorithms behave w.r.t. numerical  and categorical variables ?
    a. Decision Tree uses different ways to split numerical and categorical predictors/variables.
3. How these algorithms works with Text Data ?
     a. Stemming and  Lemmatization
     b. Bag of words
     c. TF-DIF
     d. Word2Vec
4. For which scenario these algorithms are used?
     a. Regression - Linear regression
     b. Classification - Logistic regression , Naive Bayes Classifier
     c. Both - Decision Tree
5. Over-fitting and Under-fitting Conditions :-
     a. Hyper parameter tuning
     b. Decision Tree Pruning
6. Impact of Algorithm w.r.t Imbalanced Datasets and how do you fix that?
    In some algo, handling imbalanced is one of the parameter
    a. Binary Classification Problem
    b. Feature Scaling
          # Up-sampling
          # Down-sampling
7. Impact of Outliers, How to treat them?
8. For which Algorithm, feature Scaling/Normalization is required w.r.t Datasets:-
    a. DT, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, ADABoost - Not required
    b. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression - Required.

9. Whether Multiclass problem can be solved or not? Using Logistic we can solve using OnevsRest. Naive Basyes can solve using Multinomial NB
10. Time Complexity of an algorithm
