# Credit Card Payment Default Prediction 
Credit card is a flexible tool
by which a customer can use a bank's money for a short period of time.

Predicting accurately which customers are most probable to default represents a significant business opportunity for all banks. Bank cards are the most common credit card type in Taiwan, which emphasizes the impact of risk prediction on both the consumers and banks. 

This would inform the bankâ€™s decisions on criteria to approve a credit card application and also decide upon what credit limit to provide.


This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. 

Using the information given, predict the probability of a customer defaulting in the next month.

# Evaluation Metric 
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC
curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.


# Public and Private Split 
Test data is further divided into Public
(40%) and Private (60%)

Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data.
The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.
 

# Guidelines for Final Submission 
Please ensure that your final
submission includes the following:

Solution file containing the predicted probability in the test dataset (format is given in sample submission csv)
Code file containing the following:
Code: Note that it is mandatory to submit your code for a valid final submission
 

# Hackathon Rules 
The final standings would be based on private
leaderboard score Setting the final submission is recommended. Without a
final submission, the submission corresponding to best public score will
be taken as the final submission Entries submitted after the contest is
closed, will not be considered The code file pertaining to your final
submission is mandatory while setting final submission Throughout the
hackathon, you are expected to respect fellow hackers and act with high
integrity.
